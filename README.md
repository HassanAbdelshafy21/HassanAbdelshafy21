### 🚀 Featured Projects

#### 🎙️ [Quran ASR for Kids](https://github.com/HassanAbdelshafy21/Quran-ARS)

**An advanced AI system designed to listen, transcribe, and grade children's recitation of the Holy Quran.**

* **Core Tech:** OpenAI Whisper (Fine-tuned V5-30k), PyTorch, FastAPI.
* **Innovation:** Features a "Tolerant Grader" engine using phonetic normalization to handle child speech quirks (e.g., "mumbling", "stuttering") and provides instant TTS feedback.
* **Impact:** Solves the challenge of ASR for low-resource domains (Child Arabic Speech) with ~95% practical accuracy.

#### 🤖 [Financial AI Agents](https://github.com/HassanAbdelshafy21/financial-ai-agents)

**An advanced AI-powered financial assistant.**

* **Architecture:** Multi-agent system with 9 specialized financial tools.
* **Tech Stack:** LangGraph, OpenAI GPT, SQLAlchemy, Docker.
* **Features:** Persistent conversation memory, PDF report generation, and real-time context awareness.
